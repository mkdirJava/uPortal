##### CAS Configurations only [used only on casContext.xml - see it for advanced configurations]
### so actually you don't need to adjust any properties below if you don't use CAS on email-preview
### to fix CAS setup - don't hesitate to modify logback.xml to have more logs around CAS

# server name used by user to access to the portal [https://portal.jasig.org for example]
# "serviceUrl" CAS parameter will be ${cas-config.serviceServerName}/${cas-config.emailpreviewContext}"
cas-config.serviceServerName=http://localhost:8080

# cas-config.serverName  - the server name of the server this application is hosted on 
# take care : on loadbalancing context, that can be like https://portal2.jasig.org
cas-config.serverName=http://localhost:8080

# email-preview context - usually email-preview
cas-config.emailpreviewContext=email-preview

# cas server url - the cas server [https://cas.jasig.org for example]
cas-config.casServerUrl=http://localhost:8080/cas

# CAS imap/pop serviceUrl used in the Proxy CAS configuration on the imap/pop server side
cas-config.serviceUrl=imap://mail.jasig.org

# If using PortletPreferences for obtaining credentials to authenticate to email systems, change this value
# from 'changeMe' to something else in production to insure the encrypted passwords stored in the database
# are not easily decrypted.  If you change this value after users have entered their passwords, the system will
# not be able to decrypt the user's passwords.
