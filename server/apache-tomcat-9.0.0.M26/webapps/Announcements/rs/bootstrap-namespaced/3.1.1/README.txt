This version of Bootstrap has the CSS name-spaced with the class 'bootstrap-styles' so it can be included into
uPortal 4.1 Universality and Bootstrap-enable portlets without affecting non-boostrap-enabled portlets.  It
can also be included into pre-uPortal 4.1.0 Universality systems as needed.

The Javascript is the same as the regular Bootstrap version.
